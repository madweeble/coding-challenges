2. Most Active Authors
In this challenge, the REST API contains information about a collection of users and
articles they created. Given the threshold value, the goal is to use the API to get
the list of most active authors. Specifically, the list of usernames of users with
submission count strictly greater than the given threshold. The list of usernames
must be returned in the order the users appear in the results.

To access the collection of users perform HTTP GET request to:

https://jsonmock.hackerrank.com/api/article_users?page=<pageNumber>

where <pageNumber> is an integer denoting the page of the results to return.

For example, GET request to:

https://jsonmock.hackerrank.com/api/article_users/search?page=2

will return the second page of the collection of users. Pages are numbered from 1,
so in order to access the first page, you need to ask for page number 1.

The response to such request is a JSON with the following 5 fields:

page: The current page of the results
per_page: The maximum number of users returned per page.
total: The total number of users on all pages of the result.
total_pages: The total number of pages with results.
data: An array of objects containing users returned on the requested page

Each user record has the following schema:

id: unique ID of the user
username: the username of the user
about: the about information of the user
submitted: total number of articles submitted by the user
updated_at: the date and time of the last update to this record
submission_count: the number of submitted articles that are approved
comment_count: the total number of comments the user made
created_at: the date and time when the record was created
